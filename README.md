## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Those are my public repos:

- [zanon.dev](https://github.com/diegozanon/zanon.dev): my unreleased new blog, designed from scratch with a strong focus on performance optimization and minimal JavaScript footprint for faster load times. Deployment was automated using Webhooks and Serverless architecture with AWS infrastructure.
- [zanon.io](https://github.com/diegozanon/zanon.io): my former blog, primarily focused on AWS topics. It featured a custom-made blog engine called [blode](https://github.com/diegozanon/blode), built with Node.js, and a frontend developed with AngularJS.
- [Paulie](https://github.com/diegozanon/paulie): an NPM module leveraging Amazon Polly to facilitate foreign language learning using the shadowing technique.
- [bombermon](https://github.com/diegozanon/bombermon): a serverless multiplayer game prototype, created to demonstrate the feasibility of using serverless architecture for real-time multiplayer games. Developed with the Phaser engine (JavaScript), it was an innovative approach to gaming infrastructure in 2016.
- [serverless-store](https://github.com/diegozanon/serverless-store): a project developed as a tutorial for [my book](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/building-serverless-web-applications-9781787123076). It showcases the use of multiple serverless tools (AWS) combined with a React-based frontend.
- [serverless-notifications](https://github.com/diegozanon/serverless-notifications): a proof-of-concept for serverless notifications. The way that I've implemented was innovative at the time (2016).
- [estomatoweb-scraper](estomatoweb-scraper): a desktop application built with NW.js (Node.js) to support my wife and her research team during her master's degree collecting data using web scraping.
